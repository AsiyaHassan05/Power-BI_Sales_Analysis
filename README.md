# Power BI Sales Analysis

### Project Overview  
This repository contains a Microsoft Power BI (.pbix) file which presents a sales analysis dashboard. The goal is to transform raw sales data into actionable insights — enabling business users to explore performance by region, product, time period, and other key dimensions.

## Contents  
- `Sales.pbix` – The main Power BI report file.  
- (Optional) `README.md` – This file.  
- (Optional) any supporting files/data/queries (if included in the future).

##  Key Features  
- Interactive dashboards with filter and slicer support (e.g., by Region, Product Category, Time Period).  
- Visualizations such as:  
  - Total sales over time  
  - Product-category breakdown  
  - Regional performance map/chart  
  - Top performing customers/segments  
- Ability to drill down/dynamic filtering for detailed analysis.  
- Designed for business users to understand sales trends, identify opportunities, and make data-driven decisions.

##  Data Source  
- The dataset used in this report includes sales transactions (date, product, region, customer, amount, etc.).  
- (You may replace this with exact source: e.g., “CSV file exported from ERP”, “SQL Server sales database”, “Excel workbook”, etc.)  
- Data refresh strategy: (e.g., manual refresh)  
- Note: Please ensure you have proper data permissions before loading into Power BI.
